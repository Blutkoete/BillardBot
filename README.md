# Discord BillardBot
As our monthly billard meeting has been moved to Discord due to the current circumstances, we need a simple bot that allows us to play billard there.

## Usage
Acquire the token by contacting me. Copy _template_token.js_ to _token.js_ and add the token there. If you ever commit the token to a public repository, you have to pay multiple rounds of drinks! Then, use Node.js to launch the bot. It has already been added to my server with permissions to view channels, send text messages and upload images and add links and reactions.

### Note
It is probably not possible that two persons developing the bot can connect to Discord at the same time, but I don't know what happens in that case. Maybe reality ends.
